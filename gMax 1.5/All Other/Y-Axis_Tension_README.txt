Version: 1.1

Improvement Realized:
  This assembly will allow for adjustment of the Y-axis belt tension without requiring major movement of the
  printer.

Hardware Required:
  T-Slot nuts for the extrusion
  Bolts for the T-Slot nuts
  1/4" square nut (for the block)
  1/4" nut (see Assembly section for more detail)
  1/4" bolt, 3.5" or 4", fully threaded
    NOTE: Threaded rod and additional nuts can take the place of the bolt
  Existing hardware from old Y-axis assembly
  NOTE: M6 hardware can be utilized instead of 1/4" if required

Infill Suggestions:
  Print at 40% - 60% infill

Assembly:
  Remove the pulley assembly from the old Y-axis mount and install the same way on the new one.  Install the 
  square nut into the block, and insert into the frame.  Insert the bolt from the far end of the bracket
  and thread into the nut in the block.  Bolt the assembly to the frame, and install the Y-axis belt as 
  normal.  Tighten as much as possible by hand.  Once completed, utilize the bolt to tighten the belt.
  DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN YOUR BELT!  It can snap!  

  You can print a knob to affix to the bolt to make it easier to turn by hand.  Another addition is a nut
  against the block to ensure the block does not have any play against the square nut in the block to prevent
  any possible Y-axis jitter.
