Part: Jank3D BLTouch Height Adjustor
Filename: jank3d-BLT-height-adjustor-0.1.stl
Designer: Jank3D Crew
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1

Improvement Realized:
  Used to help calibrate the BLTouch auto leveling sensor to the gMax or Jank3D printer.

Hardware Required:
  BLTouch sensor

Infill Suggestions:
  Print at 10% - 15% infill

Assembly:
  This disk is printed fully assembled.  For best results ensure the disk is 8mm tall with a caliper to help
  ensure correct calibration of the BLTouch sensor to your printer.  

  To use the disk, lower your nozzle to the bed.  Place the pin in the hole of the alignment disk and fix
  your mount such that the bottom of the BLTouch probe rests on the top of the disk.  Normally, this will
  create an offset of -0.85 Y offset in the firmware, however tweaking may be required for proper 
  height adjustment.
